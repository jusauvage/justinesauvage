        I am currently at the intersection of formal methods and cryptographic verification. 
        I have a strong interest in computer-aided verifications: studying and developing formal verification frameworks, 
        improving existing tools, and applying them to real-world systems. 
        While I am always eager to dive into proving new protocols, I also enjoy tackling theoretical questions about the nature of proofs: (How) Can we automate verification? What is the scope of a given verification framework? And how can we scale these methods to handle more complex systems, new arguments, etc. ?
